## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("Virginia_Employment_Status_of_the_Population_by_Sex_by_Race_and_by_Age_by_Year.csv")
```

Graph 1 
```{r}
data %>%
  filter(PopulationGroup == "Total") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year,
                y = CivilianLaborForce,
                color = "Labor force")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year,
                y = CivilianNonInstitutionalPopulation,
                color = "Population")) +
  scale_color_manual("", 
                     values = c(
    "Labor force" = "red",
    "Population" = "blue")) +
  labs(y = "The number of people (thousand)",
       title = "Difference Between Labor Force and Population",
       subtitle = "The increase of labor force fluctuates, while total population increases steadily in Virginia.",
       caption = "Source: data.virginia.gov")
```

Graph2 
```{r}
data %>%
  filter(GroupCode == "01") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = CivilianLaborForceUnemployedPercentOfPopulation)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = CivilianLaborForceUnemployedPercentOfPopulation),
            vjust = 2,
            nudge_x = 0.1) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1,8)) +
labs(title = "Virginia's Unemployment Rate Fluctuates around 5% in Recent Years",
     subtitle = "Unemployment rate in Virginia increased dramatically in 2020, probably due to the pandemic.",
       caption = "Source: data.virginia.gov",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Unemployment Rate (%)")

```
Graph3 
```{r}
data %>%
  filter(PopulationGroup == "Asian" | PopulationGroup == "Black or African American" |
           PopulationGroup == "White" |
           PopulationGroup == "Hispanic or Latino ethnicity") %>%
  filter(Year >= 2016) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = Year,
               y = CivilianLaborForceUnemployedPercentOfPopulation,
               fill = PopulationGroup),
           position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue","light blue","purple","pink")) +
  labs(y = "Unemployment rate (%)", 
       title = "Unemployment Rate among African American Is Normally the Highest",
       subtitle = "Unemployment rate among minority groups has been higher than among white people in the past 5 years in Virginia.",
       caption = "Source: data.virginia.gov")

```
Overall, the unemployment rate by race fluctuated in the recent 5 years (2016-2020) in Virginia. Among four races, Black experienced the highest unemployment rate until 2020, while the unemployment rate of White was the lowest over years. It's worth noting that COVID-19 had exacted a significant toll on the labor market in Virginia. The unemployment rates of four races have significantly risen in 2020, especially for minority communities (Asian, Black, and Hispanic). Minority communities faced worse labor market outcomes than the aggregate or averages suggest. Policies should not only aim to stimulate overall employment but also needs to promote equitable outcomes in the labor market.

cp$is_free <- function() TRUE

data %>%
  filter(PopulationGroup == "Men"|
           PopulationGroup == "Women") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", 
             y = CivilianLaborForce,
             fill = PopulationGroup)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           color = "black",
           width = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label=CivilianLaborForce),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),

  labs(title = "The Number of Women in the Labor Force Is Lower in Virginia",
       subtitle = "The number of women in the labor force has normally been lower than men in Virginia in the past 17 years.",
       caption = "Source: data.virginia.gov")

```
Overall, the number of women in the labor force was lower than men's in Virginal in recent 17 years (2004-2020). The percentage of women in the workforce was stable over 17 years, with women accounting for approximately 48% of the workforce in Virginia. Accounting for the fact the percentage of the female population is higher than men, policies should incentivize women's participation in the labor force to stimulate the increase rate of the labor force, as shown in graph 1.
